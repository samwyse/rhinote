Rhinote is a simple Python/Tkinter script which provides virtual 'sticky-notes' on your desktop. It's handy for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text that you plan to paste elsewhere later. Text can be cut, copied, and pasted; and notes can be saved (as plain text) and viewed and/or edited later, in Rhinote or any other text-editing application. While many such applications exist for virtually all computing platforms, Rhinote is extremely simple, lightweight, and 'keyboard-friendly.'

Free and Open Source software licensed under the GNU General Public License, Rhinote should run on any computer that has Python 2.3 or later and its Tkinter module installed. It has been successfully run on various distributions of Linux, as well as Windows 98SE, ME, and XP. (Presumably, it will run on Windows Vista and Mac OS as well, as long as Python lives on the system.)
